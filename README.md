# cs246-android-2

Program Description: 

This is an adaptation of the Capitalization Application I created in Java.
The Capitalization Application is
"A program that changes the capitalization of the user's input string.
It is to then display the capitalization"


- Have at least one screen (DONE)
- Be interactive with the user (DONE)
- Be helpful in performing a task that you, or someone you know, do on a frequent basis (DONE: I had to use SQL a lot this semester, and I'd sometimes need to capitalize a whole bunch of text)
- Run successfully on an Android device (or on an emulator) (DONE)

- This is a screenshot of a bug the app has; if a newline character precedes a word, that word isn't capitalized correctly for the title case or normal case operations.
